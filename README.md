# PF2e Prisha's Precious Projectiles

A compendium of arrows, crossbow bolts, and other projectiles made from precious
materials such as cold iron and silver. For use with the Pathfinder 2e system in
Foundry VTT.

Gamemasters, please read the [installation](#installation) instructions and the
other notes below carefully.

If you experience any problems with this module, or wish to request a specific
ammunition type that we do not already have covered, please open an issue.

## Supported materials
- Cold iron
- Silver

I am looking into other materials and add as and when I can.

## Supported ammunition types
- Arrows
- Blowgun darts
- Crossbow bolts
- Repeating crossbow magazines (see [note below](#repeating-crossbow-magazines))
- Selected firearm ammunition types (see [note below](#firearm-ammunition))
- Sling bullets

### Firearm ammunition

Due to the plethora of ammunition types for firearms, I currently only support
selected types. If you have a specific need, please open an issue.

### Repeating crossbow magazines

Repeating crossbow magazines currently do not work well with the
[PF2e Ranged Combat](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pf2e-ranged-combat/)
module. The material trait will not be applied to the damage. You can work
around this by turning off **Ammunition Effects** in the **Ranged Combat**
module settings.

## Installation

You should install this module directly from the Foundry VTT package browser.

Once installed, there is a manual step you should take to make the ammunition
available in the Compendium Browser. This will make it easier for your players
to purchase the ammunition. To do this follow these steps:

1. Log in to your game world as a Gamemaster.
2. Open up the Compendium Browser from a character sheet (go to the inventory
   tab and click on any of the search icons).
3. Click on **Settings**.
4. Scroll down until you find _Prisha's Precious Projectiles_ under
   **Equipment**.
5. Check the corresponding checkbox.
6. Click on **Save Changes** and close the Compendium Browser.

## Material types

The following table lists the materials I am looking into and their status. Most
precious materials here have special rules. If those rules are not currently
automated in Foundry, I will not be supporting them. On the one hand, *cold
iron* and *silver* are well-supported by the system. On the other hand, poison
damage from *abysium* is not automated so I won't be supporting it.
